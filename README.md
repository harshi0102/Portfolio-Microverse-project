### Tech Stack <a name="tech-stack"></a>

The core concepts of HTML, CSS and github were implemented.Using HTML, I was able to create a dynamic and responsive webpage that incorporates text, images, and hyperlinks. With CSS, I was able to style and customize the layout and design of the page, creating a unique and visually appealing user experience. In addition, the project has been managed and stored using Github, which provides a powerful and reliable version control system.
